## Overview

The **NIPS Papers Semantic Search and Summarization System** is engineered to simplify the research process by transforming complex academic texts into accessible insights. The platform allows users to input a research query and instantly retrieve:

- **Relevant NIPS papers** through semantic search
- **Concise summaries** to quickly grasp core ideas
- **Diverse keywords** that highlight key topics and concepts

By streamlining the navigation of extensive machine learning literature, this system enhances research efficiency and supports informed decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleans raw text by removing HTML tags and unwanted sections. Utilizes spaCy for tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal to ensure high-quality text normalization.

- **Keyword Extraction:**  
  Employs KeyBERT along with SentenceTransformer to extract contextually relevant keywords. Uses Agglomerative Clustering to group similar keywords, ensuring a diverse set of key phrases that capture the paper's main topics.

- **Semantic Search:**  
  Implements a custom Word2Vec model to generate document embeddings, enabling semantic comparisons between user queries and research papers via cosine similarity.

- **Summarization:**  
  Generates concise and coherent summaries of research papers, allowing users to quickly understand the core ideas without reading full texts.

- **Interactive Web Interface:**  
  Built with Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface for data upload, processing, and semantic searching, complete with caching and progress spinners for an enhanced user experience.
